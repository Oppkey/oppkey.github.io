# Flutter Web Example for Oppkey

[Live Site](https://codetricity.github.io/flutter-web/#/)

Demonstration of Flutter Web for evaluation of new Oppkey site. 
This site is built with Flutter, not HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 
I didn't use templates like Bootstrap.

Responsive changes between desktop and mobile are handled with Flutter.
